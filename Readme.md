# SE 3004 Software Testing @ MSKU

This repository contains the code examples of the Software Testing class in the Department of Software Engineering at Muğla Sıtkı Koçman University.

Each folder is an independent maven project. You should be able to import the project directly in your favorite IDE (e.g., InteliiJ, Eclipse). You can also run all the tests via `mvn test`.

To run code coverage in **02-structural-testing**, go to the **02-structural-testing** folder and type `mvn clean test jacoco:report`. Then, open the `target/site/jacoco/index.html` file to see the report.
